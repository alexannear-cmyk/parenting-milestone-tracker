# Your Parenting Journey - Progress Tracker

**You're doing better than you think. Every moment counts.**

## What This Is

This is a compassionate, interactive web app designed to be the supportive friend you need during the challenging early months and years of parenting. When the days feel endless and you're counting down to nap time, this app helps you see the progress you're making—one small win at a time.

## Why This Exists

Being a parent to a newborn or infant can feel desperate and overwhelming. The crying, the sleepless nights, the feeling that your time and life have been taken over. You might find yourself constantly hoping time would speed up, desperately anticipating the next milestone age when things might get easier.

This app was created for parents in that place—to help you:
- **Track small degrees of progress** your child makes
- **Feel accomplished** by celebrating tiny wins
- **Remember you're moving forward** even when it doesn't feel like it
- **Hold onto hope** that brighter days are ahead
- **Have an interactive partner** to get you through the really hard weeks and months
